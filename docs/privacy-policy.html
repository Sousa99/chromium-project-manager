      <p>
        All data entered into the Chromium Project Manager extension—such as
        project names, ticket titles, ticket links, or any other details—is
        stored <strong>locally on your browser</strong>. This data is never sent

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Because we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your
        information in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        All actions performed within the Extension are processed
        <strong>entirely within your browser</strong>. The Extension’s purpose
        is solely to help you organize and manage your work by allowing you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and manage custom "projects"</li>
        <li>
          Add and store ticket names and URLs associated with those projects
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy relevant information to your clipboard for development and sprint
          review purposes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        All data used by the Extension is stored
        <strong>locally on your device</strong> using your browser's extension
        storage (such as <code>chrome.storage.local</code>). We do not have
        access to this data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your data remains private and secure as long as your device and browser
        are secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend following best practices for browser and device security,
        such as keeping software up-to-date and using antivirus protection.

        services, or cloud platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>5. User Accounts and Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension does <strong>not require a user account</strong> or login
        of any kind. There is no registration process, and we do not collect
        usernames, passwords, or email addresses.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy if the functionality of the Extension
        changes in a way that affects your privacy. If any future version
        introduces external services or data collection, we will update this
        policy and inform users accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage users to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
        changes.
